# Lyrics

A spike to get lyrics working in an interactive way.

- There's a thing called and [.lrc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LRC_(file_format)) file
  - How do I get `.lrc` files? [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/musichoarder/comments/12io8nm/searching_for_a_site_to_download_lrc_files/)
    - [F-lyrics](https://github.com/bunnykek/F-Lyrics)
      - Command-line tool; could be good and uses Spotify (a plus), but currently broken
    - [Lyricsify](https://lyricsify.com/)
      - On the web, good for one-offs and testing
    - [lrcget](https://github.com/tranxuanthang/lrcget)
      - Holy-f this is perfect! ...but can't install on Windows 11?
- There are React component libraries specifically for lyrics
  - e.g., [1](https://github.com/bouzidanas/lyr-ix), [2](https://github.com/mebtte/react-lrc) (better)
  - \[2\] is so good! ([wow](https://mebtte.github.io/react-lrc/?path=/story/lrc--auto-scroll&args=verticalSpace:!false))
